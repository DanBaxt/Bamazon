# Bamazon

A node app that simulates an amazon purchase page. The app asks the user to choose from a list of items to purchase, then asks how many of that item they want.
The app will show the price of their purchase, and take stock from the mysql file.

To run the app, clone the github repository, and in the terminal, install the npm packages. If you do not have mysql, you will need to install it.
Then run the app by running node bamazonCustomer.js in the terminal.
